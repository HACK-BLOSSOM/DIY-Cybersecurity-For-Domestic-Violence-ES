# DIY Cybersecurity for Domestic Violence

https://hackblossom.org/domestic-violence/

Everyone deserves privacy.
DIY Cybersecurity for Domestic Violence shares cybersecurity strategies that provide immediate and tangible protection to survivors of domestic violence. Each survivor is an authority on their own experience: I make no assumptions of what coercive control looks like for the reader. Rather, I highlight the most common patterns of tech-based abuse and suggest solutions tailored to varying degrees of safety. Every strategy is written for accessibility, emphasizing the security potential of existing technologies while minimizing the need for new products. I trust that each reader will recognize what they need and decide for themselves how to take action.
